This will assure you are on the right track as you work through the project, and you can feel more confident in your final submission meeting the criteria.  As a final check, assure you meet all the criteria on the [RUBRIC](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/37e27304-ad47-4eb0-a1ab-8c12f60e43d0/rubric).\n",

You can use the __File -> Download as -> HTML (.html)__ menu to save your notebook as an .html file.

If you made reference to other websites, books, and other resources to help you in solving tasks in the project, make sure that you document them. It is recommended that you either add a \"Resources\" section in a Markdown cell at the end of the Notebook report, or you can include a `readme.txt` file documenting your sources.\n",

You can submit your files as a .zip archive or you can link to a GitHub repository containing your project files. If you go with GitHub, note that your submission will be a snapshot of the linked repository at time of submission. It is recommended that you keep each project in a separate repository to avoid any potential confusion: if a reviewer gets multiple folders representing multiple projects, there might be confusion regarding what project is to be evaluated.\n",

If you are having any problems submitting your project or wish to check on the status of your submission, please email us at dataanalyst-project@udacity.com. In the meantime, you should feel free to continue on with your learning journey by beginning the next module in the program."
